# teletype

teletype is a cross platform high-level tty library. It provides a consistent interface between POSIX terminals and the Windows command line by building on top of terminfo and msvcrt. Teletype lets you do things like print with colours, reposition the cursor around the screen, and clear lines in a painless way. It also provides few customizeable components like a selection picker and progress bar that are pretty slick.

_**Note:** Windows is not yet supported._
